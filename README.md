# FlaskWebAPI 🚀

This project is a step-by-step **Flask-based REST API** created for **practice and learning purposes**. Each step introduces a new concept or tool to enhance the project and reinforce backend development skills.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**FlaskWebAPI** is a simple REST API application built using Flask. It’s structured as a hands-on learning project, progressing through various backend development tools and practices including Docker, API documentation, and validation libraries.

## 🛠️ Development Steps

### ✅ 1. Create REST API Endpoints

- Implemented basic RESTful routes using **Flask**.
- Routes support GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.
- Project structure organized using Blueprints for scalability.

### ✅ 2. Add Docker & Docker Compose

- Added a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
- Added `docker-compose.yml` to manage services (API + future DB).
- Enabled **debug mode** for development and hot-reloading.
- Simplifies local development and environment setup.

### ✅ 3. Integrate Flask-Smorest, Swagger UI & Marshmallow

- Switched to **Flask-Smorest** for modular route definitions.
- Added **Swagger UI** for auto-generated API documentation.
- Used **Marshmallow** for request/response schema validation.
